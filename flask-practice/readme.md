## Few concepts:

1.  _Jinja Template Engine_\
    Jinja is a **template engine** for Python that Flask uses to generate dynamic HTML. It allows you to embed Python code directly in HTML files, making it easy to create dynamic web pages. \

2.  _Sessions_\
    A session is a way to remember information about a user across different page visits. Instead of asking users to log in on every single page, you can store their identity, preferences, or other data in a session.
